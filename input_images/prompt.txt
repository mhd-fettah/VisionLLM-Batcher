Analyze the attached image of a user interface and generate a minimal product requirement summary with the following structure:

Controller:
    Controller name (e.g., CounselorController)
    List the actions/methods needed (e.g., edit, update, uploadProfilePicture)

Database:
    Main table name
    Fields (column names + types if visible/inferable)
    Note any relationships (e.g., city â†’ country foreign key)

View:
    Blade file name (e.g., counselor/edit.blade.php)
    Key components or sections (e.g., profile image upload, basic info form)

Other Notes:
    Form behavior (e.g., dynamic dropdowns, validation, file upload handling)
    Required/optional field assumptions
    Permissions or role assumptions if relevant

- Format the response in clean bullet points, no extra explanation. Keep it short and developer-friendly.
